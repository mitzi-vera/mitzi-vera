- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mitzi-vera
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development. I first studied coding back in 2012, when I was in University in the Philippines. Life had other plans for me so I didn't get to practice in this field BUT! I'm trying again :)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, Python and SQL through Harvard's free CS50 courses!
- ğŸ“« Visit me at mitzivera.com and through itsmitzivera.com!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can't work without music playing in the background! Somehow it calms me down.
